This repo contains answers to each chapter's questions in RISC-V Assembly Language by Anthony J. Dos Reis.

Questions are stored in their own directory to accomodate the files generated by the rv program. If a question requires testing, a test folder is created, with the corresponding outputs. The original binary will be stored in the parent directory, if applicable.
